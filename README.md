This project was done as a group project in class, using Unity, VSCode, and Blender,

Our objective was to create a robot capable of participating in a tournament. 
It was structured as a capture the flag tournament, with the objective being to capture more balls than your opponent. 
However the robot had to be able to ‘think’ and move on its own without manual control. 

Used Unity and Blender for this project

We first developed a strategy for it, which was to retrieve balls that were the farthest from its home base, and bring it back to its home base. 
Once it reached its home base, it would go out again and retrieve more balls. O
nce all the balls are retrieved it would try to steal the balls from its opponents base. 
If the opponent enters the surrounding area, our robot is designed to shoot lasers at the opponent, making them drop the ball. A
fter the strategy was developed and the code was implemented, I then trained our robot in virtual simulations using ML Agents and reward-based learning. 
Once it was trained for an appropriate amount of time, it was able to compete against other robots as part of the tournament, in which we got 2nd!
